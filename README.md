# Chatting-Application

Simple Node.js application i made because i want to chat to my friends without getting in trouble at school lol

# How to host it
Before we start take a note
This isnt going to work on vercel

first of all make sure you have node.js and all the necessary node modules installed and then simply 

```run node server.js``` 

if you want to host it continuously in a vps you can do 

```nohup node server.js &```
